# Motanica

## mod2-final

*End of Mod2's project where we were tasked to create a React App implementing API's.* 

### Which 3rd party API I'm using:
strainapi.evanbusse.com/API_KEY

### Problem statement 
(which problem I am trying to solve)

**Motanica** is an App that outputs educational Cannabis information depending on *user selection*. It allows the user to search by different parameters to obtain a strain's name, flavor, effects (whether said effects are positive or negative), etc. 

### Target users 
The target users are individuals who are interested in the potential benefits of Cannabis, and want a more customizable visual approach to gaining insight. 

### Wireframe 
(in progress)

*2 Stateful components 5 functional components (presentational components / no stateful logic)*

App.js (stateful) -> users signup form (stateful) -> confirmation box/lightboxes/modal (functional/presentational)

App.js -> Verify Age-> Navbar.js -> Sativa -> Hybrid -> Indica -> Home Page.js -> ?

       }
   }
